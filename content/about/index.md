# Who I am?

Hi, I am Jordan. I am a maths PhD with an active interest in computer science and new technologies. When I was still doing maths research, I would often use Python or [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) to help me gain insights on the problems I was working on.

Having fond memories of trying to code efficiently to simulate dynamical systems on an overheating laptop, and even though not I am doing research anymore, I still very much enjoy learning about algos and their mathematical or real world applications.


# What is this blog?

This blog will contain all things related to maths, computer science, AI or Python that I find fun. Hopefully, in time, it will serve both as notes for future me and as a testament to my growth in these areas.

Eventually, I intend this to be full of posts about:

* the underlying maths of modern technologies (mostly for people with a maths background);
* fun or pretty maths visuals;
* more or less concrete projects, cause Jupyter Notebooks are cool, but webapps are cooler;
* examples of algorithms that may be useful if you are into things like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I hope you enjoy your time spent here. Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jordanemme@protonmail.com) for any enquiries or comments.su
