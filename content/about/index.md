# Who I am

Hi, I'm Jordan, welcome to my personal blog.

I am a maths Ph.D. with an active interest in deep learning and data visualisation. After using Python for my own research for a number of years, I decided to study the tools and techniques dedicated to data science. I hope this website will become a testament to my growth in this area.


# What is this blog?


Here, you will find and collection of my personal projects, as well as blog posts, mostly about:
* Data analysis on subjects I'm passionate about (for everyone)
* Tutorials (by a beginner, for beginners)
* Notes about my projects and issues encountered (for everyone, and future me)
* Notes/ramblings about the mathematics behind current data science techniques (for the curious mathematician).

I hope you enjoy your time spent here. Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jordanemme@protonmail.com) for any enquiries or comments.
