Hi, I am Jordan,

I am a software engineer, passionate about all things at the
intersection of programming, computer science, and mathematics.

I have recently worked at Gravity Sketch, where I contributed in building the
geometry kernel of the eponymous application, a collaborative, VR, 3D modelling
tool.

Before that, I was a mathematician, and studied stuff related to symbolic
dynamics and thermodynamic formalism.

This is a place for me to ramble about work or hobby projects, hope you enjoy
your stay!
